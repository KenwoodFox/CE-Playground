Program your LED to blink on/off every second when the bump switch is pressed\
program the wheels to turn cw for 1 revolution, wait 2 seconds, then reverse until the limit switch is pressed
stop LED blinking when bump switch is pressed again

notes:
We're doing two things at once, blinking, and running a motor, the cortex only has one thread, how will this work?
